                        <p class="sr-content lightfont paragraph sfm-bg-dark-left  "> NLP- Neuro Linguistic Programming – A broad series of techniques for modeling and achieving success and excellence in every area of life.<span class="read-more animate__animated animate__fadeInUp"> It is the study of behavioral excellence. NLP has many areas of mainstream practice including psychotherapy and counseling, management, and sales training, sports performance, public and motivational speaking, business and life coaching as well as alternative and new-age thought. NLP is the study of how information is stored as it is received by the 5 senses and the imagination, and the meaning that is attached to it. By changing any of these elements, also called ‘re-framing’ we can change one’s experience of the world and more consciously shape reality in ways that are desired. This can best be recognized when dealing with fears. The object of fear and distress has been stored in a specific way in the mind and a particular meaning, rational or irrational has been attached to that experience. Using NLP techniques it is actually very simple to re-create a different experience around the object or situation allowing people to experience fearful objects and situations as though they never existed.
